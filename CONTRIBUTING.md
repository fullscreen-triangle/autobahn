## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70.0 or later
- Git
- Basic understanding of consciousness theory and biological systems (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/autobahn.git
   cd autobahn
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   make test
   make run-demo
   ```

## Development Environment

### Required Tools

The setup script will install these automatically:

- **rustfmt** - Code formatting
- **clippy** - Linting
- **cargo-audit** - Security auditing
- **cargo-watch** - File watching for development
- **cargo-tree** - Dependency analysis
- **cargo-outdated** - Dependency updates

### Recommended IDE Setup

**VS Code:**
- Rust Analyzer extension
- Better TOML extension
- GitLens extension

**RustRover/IntelliJ:**
- Rust plugin
- TOML plugin

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development with auto-reload
make dev-server

# Run tests in watch mode
make dev-test

# Check code quality
make lint-all

# Run full CI checks locally
make ci-check
```

## Code Style

### Formatting

We use `rustfmt` with the configuration in `rustfmt.toml`:

```bash
# Format all code
make fmt

# Check formatting
make fmt-check
```

### Linting

We use `clippy` with strict settings in `clippy.toml`:

```bash
# Run linting
make clippy

# Fix automatically fixable issues
make clippy-fix
```

### Naming Conventions

**For Consciousness Framework:**
- Use scientific terminology accurately
- Prefer descriptive names for biological processes
- Use abbreviations sparingly (ATP, RAG, BMD are acceptable)
- Mathematical variables can use single letters (phi, gamma, etc.)

**Examples:**
```rust
// Good
struct FireConsciousnessEngine { ... }
fn calculate_phi_value(&self) -> f64 { ... }
let membrane_efficiency = 0.89;

// Avoid
struct FCE { ... }
fn calc(&self) -> f64 { ... }
let x = 0.89;
```

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and modules
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **Consciousness Tests** - Test emergence and awareness detection
4. **Biological Tests** - Test metabolic and biological processes
5. **Performance Tests** - Benchmarks for critical paths

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific categories
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-examples

# With verbose output
make test-verbose

# Benchmarks
make bench
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
