### Migration Guides

#### Upgrading from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0

**System Initialization:**
```rust
// Old
let system = AutobahnSystem::new().await?;

// New
let system = AutobahnSystem::new(0.5).await?; // 0.5 MYA evolutionary timeline
```

**Response Handling:**
```rust
// Old
match response {
    RAGResponse::Success { content, quality } => { ... }
}

// New
match response {
    RAGResponse::Success { 
        response_text, 
        quality_score, 
        consciousness_level,
        atp_consumption,
        .. 
    } => { ... }
}
```

**Configuration:**
```rust
// Old
let config = RAGConfiguration::default();

// New
let config = RAGConfiguration {
    max_atp: 15000.0,
    operating_temperature: 310.0,
    consciousness_emergence_threshold: 0.7,
    hierarchy_levels_enabled: vec![
        HierarchyLevel::Molecular,
        HierarchyLevel::Cellular,
        HierarchyLevel::Organismal,
